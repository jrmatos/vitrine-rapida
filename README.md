# vitrine-rapida

Vitrine RÃ¡pida is a project that was created by me as a startup product in 2020. Its motivation was to provide a place where small stores could show their products and their customers could order them using Whatsapp.

For some reasons, the business was not succesful but I decided to share the work done here on my GitHub for study purposes.

To understand it little better, you can see the promotional YouTube video:
